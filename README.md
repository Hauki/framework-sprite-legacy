framework-sprite-legacy
=======================

This project contains two Corona Sprite samples using the legacy sprite libary. You can download either sample and **require** the **sprite.lua** file from the sample into your project requiring legacy Sprite support.

Note: If you project is using ParticleCandy, you will need to include the legacy **Sprite library**..
